# Comparison of Bootstrap and Jackknife Methods

## Overview
This repository contains R Markdown code that replicates the methodologies and results from **Oyeyemi's paper:**

> *Comparison of Bootstrap and Jackknife Methods of Re-Sampling in Estimating Population Parameters.*

The purpose of this project is to implement and compare the **Bootstrap** and **Jackknife** resampling techniques for estimating population parameters using R. This work provides insights into the performance and accuracy of both methods as discussed in the original paper.
